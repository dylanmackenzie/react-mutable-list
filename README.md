Mutable List
============

A [draggable, droppable and deletable list
component](//dylanmackenzie.github.io/react-mutable-list) for React. It
is still being actively developed, and bugs are still being found, so
issues on github are welcome. Documentation is generated by react-docgen
and can be found in the docs folder.

Installation
------------

To install simply

    npm install react-mutable-list

Functionality is exposed in three different ways:

- es6/jsx files in `src/`
- es5 files with commonJS exports in `lib/`
- a prepackaged version with the entire react library under `dist/list.js`

Example
-------

This example shows how the user might handle the onReorder and onRemove
callbacks. The controller is responsible for managing the content passed
into the list, and it uses the onReorder and onRemove callbacks to
handle the corresponding events from the list.

```js
import React from 'react'
import { List, ListItem } from 'react-mutable-list'

class Controller extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props)
        this.state = {
            items: ['hello', 'world']
        }
    }

    onReorder(from, to) {
        this.setState(state => {
            let tmp = state.items[from]
            state.items.splice(from, 1)
            state.items.splice(to, 0, tmp)
        })
    }


    onRemove(index) {
        this.setState(state => {
            state.items.splice(index, 1)
        })
    }

    reorder() {
        return (
            <List onReorder={(f, t) => this.onReorder(f, t)}>
            {this.state.items.map((item, i) => (
                <ListItem onRemove={e => this.onRemove(i)}>{item}</ListItem>
            ))}
            </List>
        )
    }
}
```
